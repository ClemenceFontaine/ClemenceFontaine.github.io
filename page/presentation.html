  <h5> Based between Brussels and Nancy, I am interested in multidisciplinary practices and recently, thinking about  the notion of meteorology as an example of a relationship between a society and its environment. I am very captivated by the Environmental Humanities and their importance in our time.
</br> </br> First graduated in Communication at ENSAD in Nancy, </br>I continued my studies at Erg in Brussels in master 'Design et Politique du Multiple'. There I develop a practice halfway between video installation and Graphic Design.</h5>
