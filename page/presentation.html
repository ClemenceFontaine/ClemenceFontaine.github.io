  <h5> Based between Brussels and Nancy, I am interested in multidisciplinary practices and recently thinking about  the notion of meteorology as an example of a relationship between a society and its environment. I'm very interested by the Environnemental Humanities and his importance in our age. </h5>
  <h5> First graduated in Communication at ENSAD in Nancy, I then continued my studies at Erg in Brussels in 'Design et Politique du Multiple'. There I develop a practice halfway between video installation and Graphic Design.</h5>
